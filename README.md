## Car Traveling Around the Globe - Android Application

This project demonstrates a dynamic "car traveling around the globe" animation using Android Studio. The application includes various animations for objects such as the sun, clouds, Earth, a car, and a rock, alongside interactive traffic light signals.

### Key Features:
- **Sun Animation**: The sun rotates around the Earth’s center, looping indefinitely.
- **Cloud Animation**: Two clouds translate across the screen at different speeds, appearing either in front of or behind the sun based on position.
- **Earth Scene**: Earth remains stationary with a traffic light at the top and a rock at the bottom.
- **Traffic Light**: Cycles through red, orange, and green, triggering the car’s movement when green.
- **Car and Rock Interaction**: The car circles the globe, slowing down when touching the rock, which falls and settles in a new position.

Animations are created using both tween and frame animation methods, ensuring smooth transitions and engaging visuals.
